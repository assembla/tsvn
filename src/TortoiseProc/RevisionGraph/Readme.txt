I hope I have your attention now.
This seems to be the only way, because you don't answer any mails,
you don't read the mailing list, you simply ignore me. And your
tigris.org mail address is invalid.

TortoiseSVN is an open source project, and committers are required
to work together. If you can't do that or are not willing to 
participate in discussions, then please say so and leave. But don't
just ignore me and my many, many mails I've sent you to your various
email addresses.

Even though your contribution to TortoiseSVN is excellent, I can't
deal with people implementing huge features and then ignore any
problems that are reported on the mailing list and ignore any mails
asking questions. If I have to deal with all this myself, then I'd
rather not have those features or implement them myself so I can
better support it myself.

Now: get off your ass and start answering the mails.
