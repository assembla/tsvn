Pre-Release Build of TSVN 1.1.3
-------------------------------

The nightly build has been switched to the 1.1.3 stabilisation branch
until the end of the week (2005-1-21). This is to allow more people
to test the release version and (hopefully) avoid regression bugs.


Installing the Nightly Build
----------------------------

All interaction with the repository is handled by subversion itself,
and only official subversion releases, or release candidates are used.
This greatly reduces your risk exposure when using this Beta code.

To install the latest version, you need to download the .msi file,
and use the Windows Installer to load it. Normally you can just
double-click on the file after you have downloaded it.

When installation is complete, reboot your PC, as recommended by the installer.
This ensures that all updated files get copied to their final destination.
If you are feeling lucky you can just log off and log on, but you will need
to check the version of TortoiseSVN.dll to make sure it has been updated.

You can check the revision number of the nightly build by looking at
Updates.txt which shows the repository revision that was used for the build.

The builds happen at 0000GMT and the upload happens at 0100GMT.
The upload takes about 5-10 minutes so should be completed by 0115GMT.
