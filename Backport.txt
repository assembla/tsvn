Code/build changes
------------------
* 2431 : Bug in the settings dialog where proxy settings got lost
         when using the browse button to set the SSH client.
* 2439, 2440 : Bug in blame. When blame fails return immediately so the
         error baton isn't cleared by the next log call (which is
         unnecessary anyway).
* 2444 : Fix small bug: the OK button was enabled in the commit dialog when 
         a log message from the history combo box was chosen, even though 
         the thread gathering the status was still running.
* 2453 : To the view title a traling space was added. This prevented the check
         for a patched file from succeeding and therefore the 'save' button
         was always deactivated in TortoiseMerge.
* 2456 : Fix for showing wrong number of weeks in the stats page.
* 2458 : Fix for wrong coloring of copied revisions in the log dialog.
* 2464 : Fix for broken status cache on SUBST'ed drives.
